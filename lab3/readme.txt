There are several make targets:

default:  ‘make’  will create the DiceWar program / game.
original: ‘make original’ will create the ‘original’ testing client made by the other student using the inheritance based class hierarchy
mysim:  ‘make mysim’ will create the DiceSimulator program I created for Lab1 using the inheritance based class hierarchy. No changes were made to DiceSimulator.cpp code for this assignment.
